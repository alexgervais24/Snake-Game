# Snake Game
Here is that snake game, hopfully everything goes well
I really hope that you guys like this
I spent ~5 days for the initial production
I then spent ~2 days adding the 3D affect, if you can find a way in order to fix the graphical glitch where the cobes don't overlap well, please tell me down below in a attempt
